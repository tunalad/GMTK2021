# GMTK2021 - Robot Assembly Line
Source code for GMTK 2021 entry. I actually plan to work on this so I don't want to lose it like other godot projects lmao

### Description
I had a lot of trouble getting an idea for the game. After 5h of thinking, I just decided to make some piece connecting game. In this game, you have 30 seconds to assemble as many robots as you can. The final score is shown at the end screen, so you can challenge your friends or whatever lmao.
### To-do:
* Bugs (if any, that one pickup bug is left intentionally, I think it's a pretty cool mechanic and left it like that)
* More robots variation
* Graphics update (I've underestimated how much time I was going to spend on other stuff, next time I'll join someone)
* Better sounds and music
* Make limbs move around (?)
* ? ? ?
